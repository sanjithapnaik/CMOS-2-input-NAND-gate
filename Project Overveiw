Key Components
Design Tool:

Cadence: Used for designing and simulating the CMOS NAND gate.
Circuit Design:

NAND Gate: A fundamental digital logic gate that outputs true (logic high) only when both inputs are false (logic low). It is designed using CMOS technology, which includes both PMOS and NMOS transistors.

CMOS Technology:

Transistor Configuration: PMOS and NMOS transistors arranged to implement the NAND function.
Performance Analysis:

Fall Time: The time required for the output to transition from a high to a low state.

Rise Time: The time required for the output to transition from a low to a high state.
